class BaseClient:

    Use this class to access the different functions within the SDK. You can instantiate any number of clients with different configuration that will propagate to these functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_url : typing.Optional[str]
        The base url to use for requests from the client.

    environment : TwelveLabsEnvironment
        The environment to use for requests from the client. from .environment import TwelveLabsEnvironment



        Defaults to TwelveLabsEnvironment.DEFAULT



    api_key : typing.Optional[str]
    headers : typing.Optional[typing.Dict[str, str]]
        Additional headers to send with every request.

    timeout : typing.Optional[float]
        The timeout to be used, in seconds, for requests. By default the timeout is 60 seconds, unless a custom httpx client is used, in which case this default is not enforced.

    follow_redirects : typing.Optional[bool]
        Whether the default httpx client follows redirects or not, this is irrelevant if a custom httpx client is passed in.

    httpx_client : typing.Optional[httpx.Client]
        The httpx client to use for making requests, a preconfigured client is used by default, however this is useful should you want to pass in any custom httpx configuration.

        Parameters
        ----------
        video_id : str
            The unique identifier of the video that you want to summarize.

        type : str
            Specifies the type of summary. Use one of the following values:
              - `summary`: A brief that encapsulates the key points of a video, presenting the most important information clearly and concisely.
              - `chapter`: A chronological list of all the chapters in a video, providing a granular breakdown of its content. For each chapter, the platform returns its starting and end times, measured in seconds from the beginning of the video clip, a descriptive headline that offers a brief of the events or activities within that part of the video, and an accompanying summary that elaborates on the headline.
              - `highlight`: A chronologically ordered list of the most important events within a video. Unlike chapters, highlights only capture the key moments, providing a snapshot of the video's main topics. For each highlight, the platform returns its starting and end times, measured in seconds from the beginning of the video, a title, and a brief description that captures the essence of this part of the video.

        prompt : typing.Optional[str]
            Use this field to provide context for the summarization task, such as the target audience, style, tone of voice, and purpose.

            <Note title="Notes">
            - Your prompts can be instructive or descriptive, or you can also phrase them as questions.
            - The maximum length of a prompt is 2,000 tokens.
            </Note>

            **Example**: Generate a summary of this video for a social media post, up to two sentences.

        temperature : typing.Optional[float]
            Controls the randomness of the text output generated by the model. A higher value generates more creative text, while a lower value produces more deterministic text output.

            **Default:** 0.2
            **Min:** 0
            **Max:** 1

        Parameters
        ----------
        video_id : str
            The unique identifier of the video that you want to summarize.

        type : str
            Specifies the type of summary. Use one of the following values:
              - `summary`: A brief that encapsulates the key points of a video, presenting the most important information clearly and concisely.
              - `chapter`: A chronological list of all the chapters in a video, providing a granular breakdown of its content. For each chapter, the platform returns its starting and end times, measured in seconds from the beginning of the video clip, a descriptive headline that offers a brief of the events or activities within that part of the video, and an accompanying summary that elaborates on the headline.
              - `highlight`: A chronologically ordered list of the most important events within a video. Unlike chapters, highlights only capture the key moments, providing a snapshot of the video's main topics. For each highlight, the platform returns its starting and end times, measured in seconds from the beginning of the video, a title, and a brief description that captures the essence of this part of the video.

        prompt : typing.Optional[str]
            Use this field to provide context for the summarization task, such as the target audience, style, tone of voice, and purpose.

            <Note title="Notes">
            - Your prompts can be instructive or descriptive, or you can also phrase them as questions.
            - The maximum length of a prompt is 2,000 tokens.
            </Note>

            **Example**: Generate a summary of this video for a social media post, up to two sentences.

        temperature : typing.Optional[float]
            Controls the randomness of the text output generated by the model. A higher value generates more creative text, while a lower value produces more deterministic text output.

            **Default:** 0.2
            **Min:** 0
            **Max:** 1
